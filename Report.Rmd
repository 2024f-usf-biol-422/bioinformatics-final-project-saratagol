# Background and Overview

This is a report on SARS-CoV-2, including some variant analysis [@koyama2020variant].
This report focuses on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data alongside tabular data, including a variant analysis and data summary. The primary goal is to investigate patterns in viral variants and correlate them with metadata such as species. The goal of this project was to observe differences in SNPs in two different organisms and to break down SNP data by gene. 

Key objectives include:
1. Summarizing sequencing quality.
2. Identifying frequent variants in the VCF files.
3. Correlating variant frequency with metadata from the `SraRunTable`.

# Methods

See the set of tutorials on the [vcfR package website](https://knausb.github.io/vcfR_documentation/index.html).

You may also want to use any of a range of different COVID data packages and data sources:

* https://kjhealy.github.io/covdata/
* https://github.com/como-ph/oxcovid19
* https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/10/20/searching-medrxivr-and-biorxiv-preprint-data/
* https://covidtracking.com/data/api
  * `readr::read_csv("https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.csv")`

## Sequencing Data Analysis
Sequencing data were processed using `bwa` for alignment and `bcftools` for variant calling. The resulting VCF files were analyzed for variant frequencies and annotated with metadata.

## Tabular Data Analysis
The `SraRunTable.csv` was analyzed in R to summarize sample metadata and investigate patterns by region and sequencing platform.

All analyses were conducted using R scripts integrated into this RMarkdown file, ensuring reproducibility.

# Results and Discussion

```{r load-packages-and-functions, include=FALSE}
library("vcfR")
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")
library("ggthemes")

# this loads all function files in the code/functions directory
function_paths <- list.files("code/functions", full.names = TRUE)
purrr::walk(function_paths, source)
```

```{r load-sra-data, include=FALSE}
# Load the SRA data
sra_data <- read.csv("data/00_sra_runtable/SraRunTable.csv", header = TRUE)

# Check the first few rows and column names
head(sra_data)
colnames(sra_data)

# Extract treatment and simulate viral load
sra_data <- sra_data %>%
  mutate(
    treatment = case_when(
      grepl("paxlovid", Sample.Name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Paxlovid",
      grepl("molnupiravir", Sample.Name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Molnupiravir",
      grepl("nirmatrelvir", Sample.Name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Nirmatrelvir",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    ),
    viral_load = abs(rnorm(nrow(sra_data), mean = 1e5, sd = 2e4)) # Simulate viral load for demonstration
  )

# Check data
head(sra_data)
```

```{r load-vcf-data, include=FALSE}
# load in, tidy, and stack all of the VCF files in the target directory
# these are the output of the bash pipeline
stacked_vcfs <- parse_tidy_and_stack_vcfs(vcf_dir_path = params$vcf_dir_path)

# load in the gff file with genome annotations for SARS-CoV-2
gff <- read_gff(gff_file_path = params$gff_file_path)

# pull out just the named genes from the annotation file
gene_table <- extract_genes_from_gff(annotation_object = gff)

# combine the stacked vcf table with the gene names and the metadata from
# the sra runtable file
vcf_with_metadata <-
  add_genes_metadata_to_vcfstack(sra_runtable_path = params$sra_runtable_path,
                                 stacked_vcf = stacked_vcfs,
                                 cleaned_genes_table = gene_table)
```

# Figures

```{r unique SNP locations, fig.cap="Unique SNP Locations"}
# create a plot of unique SNP locations within each gene across all samples
vcf_with_metadata %>%
  filter(!is.na(gene)) %>% # get rid of SNPs not in gene regions
  group_by(gene, pos) %>%
  tally() %>% # this gives a column n for the number of gene by position
  group_by(gene) %>%
  tally() %>% # this collapses that down to the number of unique SNP locations
  ggplot(aes(x = gene,
             y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Count of distinct SNPs in Named SARS-CoV-2 Genes",
       x = "Gene Name") +
  theme_few() # get rid of the grey background
```
**Figure 1**: ORF1ab and S genes have more unique SNPs in the set of samples analyzed.


```{r snp-distribution-genome, fig.cap="Distribution of SNPs Across the Genome"}
vcf_with_metadata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pos)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "SNP Distribution Across the Genome",
       x = "Genomic Position (bp)",
       y = "Frequency of SNPs") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Figure 2**: Most SNPs occur between 20,000 and 25,000 bp. 

```{r ferret-hamster-sample-count, fig.cap="Sample Count for Ferrets vs Hamsters"}
vcf_with_metadata %>%
  filter(!is.na(lab_host) & lab_host %in% c("ferret", "Roborovski dwarf hamster")) %>%
  group_by(lab_host) %>%
  summarize(snp_count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lab_host, y = snp_count, fill = lab_host)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "SNP Count for Ferrets vs Hamsters",
    x = "Lab Host",
    y = "Number of SNPs"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("ferret" = "purple", "Roborovski dwarf hamster" = "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Figure 3**: Roborovski dwarf hamster has more SNPs than ferret. 

```{r snp-counts-sample, fig.cap="SNP Counts Per Sample"}
vcf_with_metadata %>%
  group_by(sample) %>%
  summarize(snp_count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(sample, snp_count), y = snp_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "SNP Counts Per Sample",
       x = "Sample ID",
       y = "Number of SNPs") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), # Hides overlapping labels
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)))
```
**Figure 4**: There is a variety in number of SNPs per sample. 


```{r gene-length-distribution, fig.cap="Gene length distribution in SARS-CoV-2 genome"}
# create a plot of gene length distribution 
gene_table %>%
  mutate(length = end - start) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "darkblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Gene Length Distribution",
       x = "Gene Length (bp)", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Figure 5**: ORF1ab and S genes are much larger in legth than the other genes. 

```{r snp-gene-length-correlation, fig.cap="Correlation between SNP counts and gene length"}
# create a plot of correlation Between SNP Counts and Gene Length
gene_table_with_snps <- vcf_with_metadata %>%
  filter(!is.na(gene)) %>%
  group_by(gene) %>%
  summarize(snp_count = n()) %>%
  left_join(gene_table, by = c("gene" = "gene_name")) %>%
  mutate(length = end - start)

ggplot(gene_table_with_snps, aes(x = length, y = snp_count)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Between SNP Counts and Gene Length",
       x = "Gene Length (bp)", y = "Number of SNPs") +
  theme_minimal()
```
**Figure 6**: Another way to demonstrate ORF1ab and S genes are larger genes and therfore are more likely to have SNPs. 

# Tables

```{r gene-summary-table}
# A table with a summary of Gene Information
gene_table %>%
  mutate(length = end - start) %>%
  select(gene_name, start, end, length) %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Gene Name", "Start", "End", "Length (bp)"))
```
**Table 1**: Gene names, locations, and lengths in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
```{r top-snps-genes-table}
# A table with top 5 Genes with Highest SNP Counts
vcf_with_metadata %>%
  filter(!is.na(gene)) %>%
  group_by(gene) %>%
  summarize(snp_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(snp_count)) %>%
  head(5) %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Gene Name", "SNP Count"))
```
**Table 2**: Gene names and SNP counts. Higher SNP counts in the S and ORF1ab genes are possibly related to the larger size of these genes.
